Hi, I'm Laura. I'm a systems neuroscientist who uses a behaviour-first approach to understand how the brain can learn from and exploit complex, changing environments. I believe that the study of naturalistic behaviours such as foraging can allow greater insight into the neural mechanisms that have evolved to support flexible higher order cognitive processes such as decision-making, planning, and memory.

I'm currently a postdoc in the <a href="https://dudmanlab.org/html/index3.html">Dudman lab</a> at HHMI's <a href="https://www.janelia.org/">Janelia Research Campus</a> in Virginia. In my current research I'm using fibre photometry to record dopamine in the striatum as naive mice learn about many changing options in a large arena. Before moving to the U.S., I completed a <a href="https://uni-of-oxford.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/185/~/what-is-a-dphil%3F">D.Phil.</a> in the <a href="https://www.waltonlab.org/">Walton</a> and <a href ="https://www.masudhusain.org/">Husain</a> labs at the University of Oxford. During my D.Phil. I trained rats to make or withhold movement to understand the relationship between ventral striatal dopamine release and motivated action. My research has resulted in a number of <a href="https://lauralgrima.github.io/publications">publications</a>.

In my spare time I enjoy playing videogames, hanging out with my cat Waneta, and briefly indulging in and then abandoning various creative pursuits - painting, embroidery, playing the piano...
