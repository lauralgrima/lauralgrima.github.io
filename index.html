Hi, I'm Laura. I'm a systems neuroscientist who uses a behaviour-first approach to understand how the brain can learn from and exploit complex, changing environments. I believe that the study of naturalistic behaviours such as foraging will allow greater insight into the brain-based mechanisms that have evolved to support sophisticated cognitive processes such as learning, decision-making, and memory.

I'm currently a postdoc in the <a href="https://dudmanlab.org/html/index3.html">Dudman lab</a> at HHMI's <a href="https://www.janelia.org/">Janelia Research Campus</a> in Virginia.
